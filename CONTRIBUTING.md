## 🎨 Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints where possible
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Comment complex logic

Example:

```python
def interference_function(
    superposition: torch.Tensor,
    weights: torch.Tensor
) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Apply interference between hypotheses.

    Args:
        superposition: (batch, seq_len, n_hyp, d_model)
        weights: (n_hyp, n_hyp) interference matrix

    Returns:
        Interfered representation of same shape
    """
    # Implementation...
```

## 🧪 Adding Experiments

When adding new experiments:

1. Create a new function in the main file or a separate script
2. Include clear documentation of what's being tested
3. Generate visualizations where helpful
4. Print summary statistics
5. Save results to files if needed

## 📊 Adding Visualizations

- Use matplotlib for consistency
- Label axes clearly
- Include titles and legends
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes
- Save at reasonable DPI (150+)
